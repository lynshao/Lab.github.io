The Intelligent Communication Lab is dedicated to pushing the frontiers of research and innovation in wireless communications, networking, and machine learning. We have a dual research focus:  one dedicated to uncovering fundamental insights, and the other focused on crafting practical solutions with real-world impact. To achieve these goals, we employ a blend of traditional techniques like signal processing and interdisciplinary methods like data science.
