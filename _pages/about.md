The Intelligent Communication Lab is dedicated to pushing the frontiers of research and innovation in wireless communications, networking, and machine learning. We have a dual research focus:  one dedicated to uncovering fundamental insights, and the other focused on crafting practical solutions with real-world impact. To achieve these goals, we employ a blend of traditional techniques like signal processing and interdisciplinary methods like data science.

# About the Supervisor

I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees (Hons.) in Communications and Information Engineering from Xidian University and my Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
