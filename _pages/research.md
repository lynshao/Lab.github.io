        Communication is more than technology; it is a foundational pillar of human civilization. For decades, its evolution, from theory to the pervasive reality of 5G and WiFi, has been a triumph of science and engineering, a testament to the pioneers who built the invisible infrastructure of our modern world.
      </p>
      
      <p style="color: #24292e; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;">
        That very success now invites a profound question: Has the era of fundamental innovation in communication passed? Some observe a mature field and suggest the core work is complete.

      <p style="color: #24292e; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: justify;">
        We see a different reality. The discipline is not ending; it is entering its most critical phase. Like physics or mathematics, communication is a bedrock science. Its prior revolutions constructed the connected world we rely upon; its next evolution will enable and define the future itself. To view this field as "solved" is to mistake a foundation for a finished building. The foundation must now be strengthened, expanded, and re-imagined to support the structures of tomorrow: the networks of distributed intelligence, the Internet of Agents, and paradigms of interaction we have yet to conceive.

            <strong style="color: #0366d6;">• The Science of Perfection: X for Communication</strong><br>
            Current networks are a monumental achievement, but they are not static endpoints. We treat standards like 5G and WiFi as living, adaptive platforms. Our work here focuses on their continuous transformation through strategic integration. We ask: How can the latest breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, advanced computing, and novel materials be fused into the communication fabric to make it radically more efficient, intelligent, and resilient? This is "X for Communication": the deliberate application of adjacent revolutions to perfect our most critical global infrastructure.

            <strong style="color: #0366d6;">• The Architecture of the Future: Communication as an Enabler</strong><br>
            Beyond evolving existing systems, we are designing the fundamental communication primitives for tomorrow's breakthroughs. The next frontiers in science and technology, from distributed AI and swarm robotics to brain-computer interfaces and planet-scale sensing, are constrained not by ideas, but by their need for new forms of dialogue. We engineer the protocols, algorithms, and system designs that allow distributed intelligences to collaborate, that turn fragmented data into coherent insight, and that make emerging technologies truly scalable and synergistic. Here, we are not merely improving communication; we are building the connective tissue of future progress.

By advancing both the enduring science of connectivity and its novel applications, we ensure that this cornerstone discipline continues to do what it has always done: not just keep pace with human ambition, but actively expand its horizon.

DEEP-IoT: Downlink-Enhanced Efficient-Power Internet of Things
=====================

At the heart of the Internet of Things (IoT) -- a domain witnessing explosive growth -- the imperative for energy efficiency and the extension of device lifespans has never been more pressing. In this line of research, we present DEEP-IoT, a revolutionary communication paradigm poised to redefine how IoT devices communicate. Through a pioneering "listen more, transmit less" strategy, DEEP-IoT challenges and transforms the traditional transmitter (IoT devices)-centric communication model to one where the receiver (the access point) play a pivotal role, thereby cutting down energy use and boosting device longevity. We not only conceptualize DEEP-IoT but also actualize it by integrating deep learning-enhanced feedback channel codes within a narrow-band system. Simulation results show a significant enhancement in the operational lifespan of IoT cells -- surpassing traditional systems using Turbo and Polar codes by up to 52.71%. This leap signifies a paradigm shift in IoT communications, setting the stage for a future where IoT devices boast unprecedented efficiency and durability.

Semantic communications
=====================

Semantic communication is an emerging research topic that has gained a wide range of attention recently. Despite this growing interest, there remains a notable absence of a comprehensive and widely-accepted framework for characterizing semantic communication. In this line of research, we introduce a new conceptualization of semantic communication and formulates two fundamental problems, which we term "language exploitation" and "language design". Our contention is that the challenge of language design can be effectively situated within the broader framework of joint source-channel coding theory, underpinned by a comprehensive end-to-end distortion metric.
To tackle the language exploitation problem, we put forth three approaches: semantic encoding, semantic decoding, and a synergistic combination of both in the form of combined semantic encoding and decoding. Furthermore, we establish the semantic distortion-cost region as a critical framework for assessing the language exploitation problem. For each of the three proposed approaches, the achievable distortion cost region is characterized. Overall, our goal is to shed light on the intricate dynamics of semantic communication, paving the way for a deeper understanding of this evolving field.

LLMind: Integrating Large language Model with Wireless Communication Systems
=====================

The exploration of large language models (LLMs) for task planning and IoT automation has recently gained significant attention. However, existing works suffer from limitations in terms of resource accessibility, complex task planning, and efficiency. In this line of research, we present LLMind, an LLM-based AI agent framework that enables effective collaboration among IoT devices for executing complex tasks. Inspired by the functional specialization theory of the brain, our framework integrates an LLM with domain-specific AI modules, enhancing its capabilities. Complex tasks, which may involve collaborations of multiple domain-specific AI modules and IoT devices, are executed through a control script generated by the LLM using a Language-Code transformation approach, which first converts language descriptions to an intermediate finite-state machine (FSM) before final precise transformation to code. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a novel experience accumulation mechanism to enhance response speed and effectiveness, allowing the framework to evolve and become progressively sophisticated through continuing user and machine interactions.
